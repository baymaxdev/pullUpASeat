 <br> <li><strong>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</strong></li><br />
      <br>The following Terms of Service Agreement (the "TOS") is a legally binding agreement that shall govern the relationship with our users and others which may interact or interface with <strong>Pull-Up-A-Seat LLC</strong> , also known as <strong>Pull-Up-A-Seat</strong> , located in Orlando, Florida and our subsidiaries and affiliates, in association with the use of the <strong>Pull-Up-A-Seat</strong> App, which includes Pullupaseatapp.com, (the "Site") and its Services, which shall be defined below. </br>
<br><li><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WEBSITE SERVICES OFFERED</BR></li></strong>
<br> The food service provider Pull-Up-A-Seat is an App based platform which has the following description:</br>
<br><strong>Pull-Up-A-Seat</strong> is a food app that allows you to find anyone cooking around you and simply 'pull up a seat'. All around you there's always someone cooking, and the options are endless when you open the door to someone's kitchen. Who knows what you could find? Maybe a fellow gluten free cook, or another paleo diet enthusiast, or maybe the best soul food cook in town. All these options could be around you, as close to you as next door, and all it takes is a food app like, <strong>Pull-Up-A-Seat</strong>, to open that door for you to truly 'pull up a seat'. Via takeout, delivery, or our coolest feature of 'social dining in', you, the customer, are now in control of what food you want and when you want it.</br>
<br>From personal individual cooks to local startups, we are bringing the great food of Orlando all to you with a tap of a button. We're the perfect app for the person who always over cooks and is left with a table full of food, or a passionate food lover that wants to share their cooking with others, or even the food lover that loves exploring all the cooking that your city has to offer....even if it's coming straight out of someone's home! You no longer have to deal with high delivery fees, overpriced order minimums, or strict hours of operations-as long as someone wants to cook; there will always be food available. </br>
<br> Any and all visitors to our app, despite whether they are registered or not, shall be deemed as "users" of the herein contained Services provided for the purpose of this TOS.
